This is a simple HTML, CSS, and Javascript classic "snake" game. Using the keyboard arrow keys, navagate the "slinker" around the board avoiding the green bad food blocks. Do try to eat the single red good food block. Slinker grows by one block for each red block consumed.

Added in rotation to the canvas... slowly rock back and forth 45 degrees while play the game... adds a challenge.
